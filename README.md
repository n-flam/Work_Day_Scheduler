# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## The Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use a library like [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. However, you can still use it for this project, or you can look into one of the following alternatives:

  * [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

  * [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

  * [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

  * [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/)

Whichever library you choose, be sure to read the documentation carefully!

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:

1. WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
3. WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
    THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. WHEN I click into a time block
    THEN I can enter an event
5. WHEN I click the save button for that time block
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
6. WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
```
